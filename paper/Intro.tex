The data set for the example project is taken from
\url{https://www.stem.org.uk/resources/elibrary/resource/28452/large-datasets-stats4schools}.
It contains data on smoking habits in the UK, with 1691 observations and 12 variables.
We consider only 4 of the 12 features for the prediction of the variable
\texttt{smoking}: \texttt{marital\_status}, \texttt{highest\_qualification},
\texttt{gender} and \texttt{age}. We model the dependence using a Logistic model. All
numerical features are included linearly, while categorical features are expanded into
dummy variables. Figures below illustrate the model predictions over the lifetime. You
will find one figure and one estimation summary table for each installed programming
language.
