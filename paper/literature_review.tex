% 1. mothers parental leave results and how they affect male parental leave
The literature of parental leave policy investigation focusses mostly on mothers' labor market outcomes, income, and child well-being.
\citet{baker2008does} investigate two Canadian maternity leave expansion lead to a higher job continuity for mothers but also find that the
extended time of leave is mostly taken up by mothers.
\citet{laliveParentalLeaveMothers2014} finds similar results in Austria where an extension in maternity leave time leads to strongly increased leave durations
while take-up for fathers remains low.
 \citet{schonbergExpansionsMaternityLeave2014} investigates multiple German parental leave reforms and finds that mothers spend more time with children with longer
maternity leave durations but does not find any improvements for mothers income or labor market attachments 2 to 6 years after birth.
Another study in the German context investigates the 2007 \textit{Elterngeld} reform heterogenous effect on different income groups of mother. The author find that
low-income mothers fertility rates decreased while that of high income mothers increased, suggesting a more hostile environment to get children for low-income mothers
\citep{cygan-rehmParentalLeaveBenefit2016}.
\citet*{frodermannParentalLeavePolicy2023} investigate the same intervention and find positive long-run effect on earnings for mothers with high pre-birth earnings but not for low-income mothers.
They add that the introduction of the "daddy months" within this reform facilitates more involvmenet of fathers and thus increased earnings for at least
high income mothers.
Parental leave policies heteregoneous effects across different socioeconomic groups seem to be robust across different high income countries \citep{canaanMaternityLeavePaternity2022}.
Though the authors find beneficial effects for mothers and childrens well-being. \\
The results of these studies suggest that there is an adverse effect of parental leave on mothers' labor market outcomes and income. Namely,
that an extension of parental leave that allocates more time or ressources to the couple or solely to the mother might negatively effect mothers
household decision making as the opportunity cost of taking care of the child becomes lower for mothers.
\citet{canaanMaternityLeavePaternity2022} argue that activating fathers to take parental leave might diminsh these adverse effects.
